\section{Introduction}

The algebraic descriptions of vector addition and scalar multiplication for vectors in a plane yield the following properties:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item For all vectors \textit{x} and \textit{y}, $x + y = y + x$.
	\item For all vectors \textit{x}, \textit{y}, and \textit{z}, $(x + y) + z = x + (y + z)$.
	\item There exists a vector denoted \textit{0} such that $x + \textit{0} = x$ for each vector \textit{x}.
	\item For each vector \textit{x} there is a vector \textit{y} such that $x + y = \textit{0}$.
	\item For each vector \textit{x}, $1x = x$.
	\item For each pair of real numbers \textit{a} and \textit{b} and each vector \textit{x}, $(ab)x = a(bx)$.
	\item For each real number \textit{a} and each pair of vectors \textit{x} and \textit{y}, $a(x + y) = ax + ay$.
	\item For each pair of real numbers \textit{a} and \textit{b} and each vector \textit{x}, $(a + b)x = ax + bx$.	
\end{enumerate}

Any mathematical structure possessing these eight properties is called a \textit{vector space}.

\section{Vector Spaces}

\begin{definition}
	A \textbf{vector space} (or \textbf{linear space}) \textbf{\textup{V}} over a field F consists of a set on which two operations (called \textbf{addition} and \textbf{scalar multiplication}, respectively) are defined so that for each pair of elements x, y, in \textbf{\textup{V}} there is a unique element $x + y$ in \textbf{\textup{V}}, and for each element a in F and each element x in \textbf{\textup{V}} there is a unique element ax in \textbf{\textup{V}}, such that the following conditions hold:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\setlength{\itemindent}{.3in}
		\item[(VS 1)] For all x, y in \textbf{\textup{V}}, $x + y = y + x$ (commutativity of addition).
		\item[(VS 2)] For all x, y, z in \textbf{\textup{V}}, $(x + y) + z = x + (y + z)$ (associativity of addition).
		\item[(VS 3)] There exists an element in \textbf{\textup{V}} denoted by 0 such that $x + \textit{0} = x$ for each x in \textbf{\textup{V}}.
		\item[(VS 4)] For each element x in \textbf{\textup{V}} there exists and element y in \textbf{\textup{V}} such that $x + y = \textit{0}$.
		\item[(VS 5)] For each element x in \textbf{\textup{V}}, $1x = x$.
		\item[(VS 6)] For each pair of elements a, b in F and each element x in \textbf{\textup{V}}, $(ab)x = a(bx)$.
		\item[(VS 7)] For each element a in F and each pair of elements x, y in \textbf{\textup{V}}, $a(x + y) = ax + ay$.
		\item[(VS 8)] For each pair of elements a, b in F and each element x in \textbf{\textup{V}}, $(a + b)x = ax + bx$.
	\end{enumerate}
	The elements x + y and ax are called the \textbf{sum} of x and y and the \textbf{product} of a and x, respectively.
\end{definition}

The elements of the field \textit{F} are called \textbf{scalars} and the elements of the vector space \textbf{V} are called \textbf{vectors}.

An object of the form $(a_1, a_2, ..., a_n)$ where the entries $a_1, a_2, ..., a_n$ are elements of a field \textit{F}, is called an \textbf{$n$-tuple} with entries from \textit{F}. The elements $a_1, a_2, ..., a_n$ are called the \textbf{entries} or \textbf{components} of the $n$-tuple. Two $n$-tuples $(a_1, a_2, ..., a_n)$ and $(b_1, b_2, ..., b_n)$ are called \textbf{equal} if $a_i = b_i$ for $i = 1, 2, ..., n$.

An $m \times n$ \textbf{matrix} with entries from a field \textit{F} is a rectangular array of the form
\[\begin{bmatrix}
	a_{11} & a_{12} & \hdots & a_{1n} \\
	a_{21} & a_{22} & \hdots & a_{2n} \\
	\vdots & \vdots & & \vdots \\
	a_{m1} & a_{m2} & \hdots & a_{mn}
\end{bmatrix}\]
where each entry $a_{ij}$ is an element of \textit{F}. We call the entries $a_{ij}$ with $i = j$ the \textbf{diagonal entries} of the matrix.

The $m \times n$ matrix in which each entry equals zero is called the \textbf{zero matrix} and is denoted by \textit{O}.

If the number of rows and columns of a matrix are equal, the matrix is called \textbf{square}.

A \textbf{polynomial} with coefficients from a field \textit{F} is an expression of the form \[f(x) = a_nx^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \hdots + a_1x + a_0,\] where $n$ is a nonnegative integer and each $a_k$, called the \textbf{coefficient} of $x^k$, is in \textit{F}. If $f(x) = 0$, then $f(x)$ is called the \textbf{zero polynomial} and, for convenience, its degree is defined to be $-1$; otherwise, the \textbf{degree} of a polynomial is defined to be the largest exponent of $x$ that appears in the representation with a nonzero coefficient.

\begin{theorem}[\textbf{Cancellation Law for Vector Addition}]
	If $x$, $y$, and $z$ are vectors in a vector space \textbf{\textup{V}} such that $x + z = y + z$ then $x = y$.
\end{theorem}

The vector \textit{0} in (VS 3) is called the \textbf{zero vector} of \textbf{V}, and the vector $y$ in (VS 4) is called the \textbf{additive inverse} of $x$ and is denoted by $-x$.

\begin{theorem}
	In any vector space \textbf{\textup{V}}, the following statements are true:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item[(a)] $0x = 0$ for each $x\in\textbf{\textup{V}}$.
		\item[(b)] $(-a)x = -(ax) = a(-x)$ for each $a\in F$ and each $x\in\textbf{\textup{V}}$.
		\item[(c)] $a\textit{0} = \textit{0}$ for each $a\in F$.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}
